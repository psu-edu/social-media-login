# Social Media Login Service Implementation Guide

## Prerequisites
* Developer account with Meta/Facebook and Google
* OAuth project established for Facebook and Google

## Setup
* Clone the GitHub repo
* Setup configuration and environment variables to include client ID, client secret for both google and facebook to match your project
* Install dependencies (use VSCode command terminal and enter "run npm init -y")
* Select deployment option for your app and deploy to the web

## Troubleshooting
* If you are unable to use the login buttons, make sure you have deployed your project to an environment that supports back end node.js
* If you are getting content unavailable or access blocked errors, make sure your URI, client ID and secret are all set up to match using the providers SDK.
